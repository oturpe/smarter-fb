## Rationale

In case you have ever user facebook, you have certainly noticed that the feed gives a very bad image of humanity. For me, the mass of content consists of random, unintelligible utterings of acquiatances that might or might not actually have some meaning in their personal life. Of course it is very flattering to think that these people decided to share the intimate thoughts with me. Unfortunately, they haven't shared any prerequisite thoughts or facts that would give that isolated string of words any meaning. 

Then there is political writing, with quality varying from utter balderbash to insightful. Unfortunately even the good part is completely ruined by the obvious fact that it is not posted because of the quality of its contents, but because it seems to support the existing values and opinions of the sharer. To the political activist on Facebook, a sound analysis of current topics with researched numbers behind it has exactly the same value as an image where the leaders of the rival party have funny expression on their faces. As long as it seems in some superficial level support your pre-existing opinion, it is worth sharing.

Then there are New Age links. Reading the incoherent rambling promising this or that cure to all ills and assigning blame for everything bad to the clearly defined and concrete entity of the (Pharmaneutical/Processed Foods/whatever) Industry can only produce one conclusion. The people sharing the links cannot possess any defensible perception of the world, they must be completely ignorant and uneducated, and have to assess the truthfulness of a claim solely on the basis on if they like the conclusion.

Any attempt to join the comments section discussion on the linked subject is bound to fail. The sharing person is obviously already set on a opinion. Actually the link was probably posted in the first place to solidify the pre-existing opinion. Other than that, the "discussion" is between people who have absolutely no knowledge of each others' background or positions and only very unclear idea on who's the audience. Unless everybody unanimously agrees in blissful unity, the argument explodes into raving contest that only ends when one side regains their senses and simply disappears from the conversation.

This text is already quite long, and I did not even get into the viral stuff, which indeed resembles the biological virus in the sense that it seems parasitic, harmful and undesirable. So, enough of horrors of the feed, here comes the solution: Smarter FB instructs AdBlock to hide all this. Of course the horror is still lurking beneath, but if you are like me, and would like to use the exellect chat platform Facebook has to offer, and are so impulsive as to at least glance at those posts in case they are very visibly in the center of the screen, you might prefer to simply not see it.

From my experience, you might encounter a sort withdrawal symptom which manifests by you scrolling up and down that list of mercifully empty white boxes, or by starting to frequent some "funniest of facebook" sort of site. Do not worry, it goes away in a couple of days.
